      <p><Strong><i>What does courage mean for <i>CleverClean</i>?</i></Strong></p>
      <p><i>CleverClean</i> understands that courage is required to run a successful business. Its managers face difficult decisions every day - and it often takes a lot of courage to make the 'right' decision. For example, managers often shy away from <strong>taking risks and being innovative</strong>.</p> 
      
      <p>This is where the Courage Award comes into play. <i>CleverClean</i> now awards managers who do not shy away but <strong>take the risk to start a highly innovative project</strong>.</p><p> Obviously, the management knows that even good ideas may fail. Thus, in case you <b></b>do not shy away but start a project which implies a substantial amount of risk and appears innovative, <i>CleverClean</i> supports you with the Courage Award.</b>  Of course, you do not receive this award for every risky project you start. You only receive this supporting award if the risky project is failing and you decide to discontinue it.</p>

          <div class="col-8"> <br>Taylor received the <i>Courage Award</i> for <b>taking the risk</b> to start an innovative project which focused on developing a cleaning product for universal usage. Unfortunately, it turned out that the overall product won’t be profitable. <i>CleverClean</i> supported Taylor’s courage of <b>taking the risk</b> to start the project by granting the Courage Award, after Taylor terminated the failing project.

    <p><Strong><i>Besides the reward ceremony, what exactly do managers receive as a Courage Award?</i></Strong></p>
    <p><i>CleverClean</i> has allocated a total budget of 0.2 million Lira for its Courage Awards. Each Courage Award is worth 1% of the 0.2 million Lira budget. However, a delayed termination of a failing risky project decreases the possibility to receive a Courage Award to 50%.</p>
